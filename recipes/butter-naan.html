    <h2>The Staple</h2>
    <p>
      Butter naan is traditional Indian Naan bread brushed with melted butter
      after cooking. You can add some minced cilantro (coriander) leaves or
      minced garlic to make garlic butter naan.

      It is a yeasted dough rolled into flatbreads and cooked traditionally in
      tandoor clay. My workaround makes it super easy to create that tandoori
      flavor and look in a cast iron skillet on the stovetop.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Plain white flour (a.k.a. maida in India)</li>
      <li>Instant dry yeast (a.k.a. quick rise yeast)</li>
      <li>Baking soda</li>
      <li>Baking powder</li>
      <li>Plain yogurt: (a.k.a curd in India)</li>
      <li>Melted butter</li>
      <li>Minced cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>

      <li>
        Boil a kettle and add a half cup hot water to a measuring cup then add
        cold water to it and check the temp to make sure I won't kill the yeast.
        120°-130°F is the ideal water temperature for quick (rapid rise) yeast.
      </li>

        The dough is supposed to be quite sticky after kneading. Wet your hands
        with water to handle it, generously flour the work surface, and oil the
        dough balls on top and bottom before letting them rise. If the dough is
        too sticky to handle, gently knead more flour into it. Be sure to let it
        rest for 1 hour if you work the dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        The 1 hour rise time is not only important for the dough to get bubbly,
        it is super important to making the naan soft. As you knead the dough
        (or have the mixer do it for you with a dough hook), you create a super
        tight, bouncy dough. If not rested, the dough will shrink up after
        rolling it out and you'll have hard, small flatbreads instead of lovely
        tender ones.
      </li>

        If you have a gas stove, you can make finish the naan over a direct
        flame to make it even more like authentic tandoori naan. When you flip
        the naan over, cook the underside for just long enough to seal the
        surface so it isn't sticky. Carefully use tongs to move the naan over to
        a direct flame. The naan will puff dramatically and yummy charred spots
        will appear. Just watch closely.
