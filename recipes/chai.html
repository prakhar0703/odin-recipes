    <h2>The beverage of India!</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Chai</strong>, also known as masala chai, is a sweet, spicy, and
      milky Indian tea made with black tea, milk, spices, and sweetener. The
      word "chai" is short for "masala chai" which translates to "spiced tea" in
      Hindi. The spices used can vary by region, but typically include cinnamon,
      cardamom, ginger, cloves, and black peppercorn.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Milk (in a ratio of roughly one part milk to two parts water)</li>
      <li>Lots of tea leaves or tea bags for strong infusion</li>
      <li>Plenty of sugar</li>
      <li>Optional addition of spices</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring water, milk and spices to a simmer in a small saucepan on the
        stove (adding the spices from the start gives them plenty of time to
        infuse).
      </li>
      <li>Reduce heat and add in black tea to brew.</li>
      <li>
        Wait for tea to steep (don't boil it at this point or the tea releases
        too many tannins - those bitter compounds that make your mouth feel
        dry).
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain the warm spiced mixture into a mug; this will hold back the whole
        spices and tea leaves.
      </li>
      <li>Stir sugar into your chai and sweeten to taste.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>List of (some)spices to use</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cinnamon</li>
      <li>Ginger</li>
      <li>Cloves</li>
      <li>Cardamom</li>
      <li>Black Pepper</li>
    </ul>
